There are three types of operators:
1.  Arithmetic operators
2.  Equality and Relational Operators
3.  Logical Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   i.   + Add
   ii.  - Subtract
   iii. * Multiply
   iv.  / Divide
   v.   ~/ Divide, returning an integer result
   vi.  % Get the remainder of an integer division (modulo)
   vii. ++ increment
   viii. -- Decrement

2. Equality and Relational Operators:
   Operators   Description                Example
i.    >         greater than             A>B is False
ii.   <         Lesser than              A<B is True
iii.  >=      Greater than or equal to   A>=B is False
iv.   <=      Less than or equal to      A<=B is True
v.    ==          Equality               A==B is False
vi.   !=         Not Equal               A!=B is True


3. Logical Operators:
Operator           Description                   Example
i. &&         And- The operator returns        (A>10 && B>10)
              true only if all the expression   is False
              specified return true.

ii. ||        OR- The Operator returns true only   (A>10 || B>10)
              if at least one of the expressions     is True.
              specified return true.

iii. !        NOT - The operator returns the inverse  !(A>10) is True
              of the expression's result. For E.g:
              !(7>5) returns false.
